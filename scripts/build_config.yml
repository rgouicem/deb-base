# Introduction
#---
# This configuration file lets you tweak the output package of
# the _build\_deb.sh_ script. Note that all fields, except those in
# the miscellaneous section, are <strong>mandatory</strong>. But it is still
# strongly recommended to fill out every field in this file to have a proper
# package.

# This example file is filled to build a binary package and library packages
# named test, libtest and libtest-dev at the same time, built from the
# same sources on an amd64 computer (the architecture of your processor doesn't
# matter when using this script, it's just that the output packages will have
# it at the end of their name).

# Filling this configuration file
#---
# Before filling this configuration file, there are some general things
# you should know.
# - Paths are relative to the one specified in the `DIRECTORYNAME` field
# - When asked for a list, you can put each item on the same line, separated
# by a space, or you can write each item on a line beginning with a hyphen
# '-', followed by a space and the item (see the examples in this file)

# Program informations
#---

# Name of the directory containing source files. This path must be relative
# to where the script is run from.
DIRECTORYNAME	: libtest-2.3.7

# Desired name of the package containing binaries (can be left empty if you
# are not building a binary package)
BINPACKAGENAME	: test

# Desired name of the packages containing libraries (can be left empty if you
# are not building library packages)
LIBPACKAGENAME	: libtest

# Program version
VERSION : 2.3.7

# Copyright : you must choose from one of these values :
# - `gpl`
# - `gpl2`
# - `gpl3`
# - `lgpl`
# - `lgpl2`
# - `lgpl3`
# - `artistic`
# - `apache`
# - `bsd`
# - `mit`
# - a path leading to your own copyright file. If using your own file
# If left empty, the script will search for files named `COPYING` or `LICENSE`
# in the `DIRECTORYNAME` folder to use them. If those files are not found, an
# empty copyright file will be put in your package
COPYRIGHT : gpl

# Developers' names, email addresses and years of activity on this project.
# Must be filled this way, and this way only to have a proper copyright
# file : `years name <email>`. If left empty, the script will search for a file
# named `AUTHORS` in the `DIRECTORYNAME` folder to fill the copyright files.
# If you are not using a generated copyright file
# (ie. the field `COPYRIGHT` is a path to your own copyright file or left
# blank), you can leave this field empty.

# The type of package you want to build :
#- `s` : build a binary package (eg. `test_2.3.7_amd64.deb`)
#- `l` : build library packages (eg. `libtest_2.3.7_amd64.deb`
# and `libtest-dev_2.3.7_amd64.deb`)
#- `s l` : if you want to build the three previous packages (you can also write
#  l s).
# Note that if you put the `s` option (respectively `l` option), the
# `BINPACKAGENAME` (respectively `LIBPACKAGENAME`) field <strong>must<\strong>
# be filled.
PACKAGETYPE : s l

# The list of packages your package depends on during the building process
# (ie. when you call make).
# You can specify some version constraints for these packages.
# Accepted symbols are <, >, =, <= and >=.
BUILDDEPENDS : libsdl2-dev libsdl2-2.0-0

# The list of packages you need to have installed when using your program.
# You can specify version constraints as explained for `BUILDDEPENDS` field.
PACKAGEDEPENDS :
  - libsdl2-2.0-0
  - perl-base (> 5.10)

# Files to include
#-----

# In this section, you can use filename expansion to avoid listing a lot of
# files in the same directory like headers or libraries.
# All paths must be relative to the directory specified in `DIRECTORYNAME`
# field previously.

# List the binaries you want to include in your binary package
BINARYNAMES : bin/testbin1 bin/testbinary

# List the libraries you want to include in your library package
LIBNAMES : lib/libTest.a

# List the headers you want to include in the -dev package
HEADERNAMES :
  - lib/*.h
  - interfaces/*.h


# Miscellaneous
#--

# The following values are used to have a "nice" package, with someone to call
# if there is a problem, descriptions, and so on. Therefore, those are not
# mandatory, but <strong>strongly recommended</strong>.
# All paths must be relative to the directory name specified in `DIRECTORYNAME`
# field previously.

# Path to the description file of the binary package. This description will be
# useful for the user if he wants to know what your package does before
# installing it, using the `dpkg -I` command, or a graphical package manager.
# You will find how to write this file in the README.md document provided with
# the scripts.
BINPACKAGEDESCFILE : test.desc

# Path to the description file of the library packages. Same as
# `BINPACKAGEDESCFILE` but for the library packages (in this example, for
# `libtest_2.3.7_amd64.deb` and `libtest-dev_2.3.7_amd64.deb`
LIBPACKAGEDESCFILE : libtest.desc

# The name of this package's maintainer (it should be yours).
DEBFULLNAME : John Doe

# The e-mail address of the maintainer of this package
DEBEMAIL : john@doe.com

# Homepage's URL you want to specify in your package
HOMEPAGE : http://www.john.doe

# An output log filename to keep track of what edits the package building script
# did, and what warnings it throwed. Can be useful to track some errors.
LOGFILE : ../build_package.log
