#How To Use This Script
#----------------------

#The purpose of this script is to create Debian packages. As you may know
#there are differents types of packages. This script allows you to create two
#differents type of packages. The first one is the binary package which contains
#binary files. The other one is the library package. When you want to create 
#a library package, two packages are actually created. Here is a quick
#description of those : 
#1. &lt;package\_name&gt;\_&lt;version&gt;.deb : This is the package containing
#the libraries.
#2. &lt;package\_name&gt;-dev\_&lt;version&gt; : This package will contain the
#header files.

#In order for this script to work correctly, some scripts and files are needed. 
#Thoses files can be found in the same repository where you've found this
#one. Here is a list of them :
#1. build_config.yml : This file contains all the informations this script
#need to build the Debian packages you want. <span class='gras'>You must
#read it, and fill it with correct informations.</span>
#2. config_parser.pl : This perl script parses the configuration file (see 
#above), and produces an output that look something like "export NAME=VALUE;".
#3. correct_lintian.pl : Perl script that correct some of the mistakes that
#lintian (command that check the conformity of packages) detects. Although this
#script is not necessary to produce a package, it's highly recommended
#to have it, in order to build a package that complies with the Debian Policy.
#4. Your project needs a makefile if you want to build a binary package. Debian
#tools need one to create binaries, in order to include them into the package.

#--------------------------------------------

#'_build\_config.yml_'. This file defines a certain number of variable (like the
#name of the packages, the version of the program, and so on ...) that this
#script will then use to build the packages the user want. <span class='gras'>
#The configuration file MUST be in the same directory as this script.</span>

#So, firstly, we check if there's a configuration file. If there isn't
#any, we exit the script.

#the configuration file also check if the user has made some mistakes when 
#he was filling it (for example, it checks if DIRECTORYNAME contains a path 
#that leads to an existing directory). So, we have to check if the script has
#terminated successfully before continuing. If it hasn't, we print an error
#message and quit the script immediatly.

#The files that debuild needs can be created automatically by the command

#2. -c : It tells dh_make we want a pre-filled copyright file.

#of the package will be something like : &lt;packagename&gt;\_&lt;version&gt;-1
#\_&lt;archi&gt;.deb.    This is not what we want. We want something like :

#.dirs file and one .install file for each package you want to build.
